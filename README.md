# Charity Donation Tracking System

The **Charity Donation Tracking System** is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows transparent and secure charity donations using **Ethereum smart contracts**. The system is built with **Hardhat** for blockchain interaction and **PHP** for the frontend, enabling donors to contribute to charity causes in a seamless and traceable manner.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Charity Donation Tracking System locally, which includes deploying the smart contract and running the frontend PHP server.

---

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- **PHP** (for frontend)
- **Composer** (for managing PHP dependencies, if necessary)
- **Hardhat** (for deploying and interacting with Ethereum smart contracts)
- **Ethereum Wallet** (e.g., MetaMask) for interacting with the smart contract during deployment and transactions.

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kba-project-main.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd kba-project-main
```

---

### Step 2: Install Smart Contract Dependencies (Hardhat)

Navigate to the **hardhat** directory and install all the required dependencies for the smart contract:

```bash
cd hardhat
npm install
```

This will install **Hardhat**, **ethers.js**, and other dependencies necessary for the smart contract development.

---

### Step 3: Compile Smart Contracts

Once the dependencies are installed, it's time to compile the smart contracts. In the **hardhat** directory, run:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

This will compile your **Solidity** contracts into artifacts, which are necessary for deployment.

---

### Step 4: Deploy the Smart Contracts

To deploy the smart contracts, you need to first start a **Hardhat network** to simulate the blockchain locally. In the **hardhat** directory, run:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This will start a local Ethereum network on `http://localhost:8545`. Keep this terminal running as the local Ethereum node.

Now, open another terminal window, navigate to the **hardhat** directory, and deploy the contracts to this local network:

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Charity.js --network localhost
```

This will deploy your smart contracts to the local Ethereum network. After successful deployment, you will see the deployed contract's address. Keep this address, as youâ€™ll need it in the next step to configure the frontend.

---

### Step 5: Configure Frontend

After deploying the smart contract, you need to update the **frontend** to interact with the deployed smart contract.

- Open the **frontend** PHP files where the contract address is referenced. 
- Paste the contract address from the deployment step into the appropriate location in the frontend code.
- You may need to configure **ethers.js** or another web3 provider in your PHP files to interact with the deployed smart contract.

For PHP, you can use the **ethers.js** JavaScript library to communicate with the Ethereum network from the frontend.

---

### Step 6: Run the PHP Server

Once the contract is deployed and the frontend is configured, you need to run the PHP server.

If you're using **PHP's built-in server**, navigate to the **frontend** directory and run:

```bash
cd frontend
php -S localhost:8000
```

This will start a local server at **http://localhost:8000**, where you can access the frontend.

Alternatively, if you are using a tool like **XAMPP** or **WAMP**, ensure that the **htdocs** or equivalent directory is set to point to the **frontend** directory, and start the server using the XAMPP/WAMP control panel.

---

### Step 7: Access the Application

Now that everything is set up, open your browser and visit:

```plaintext
http://localhost:8000
```

You should see the **Charity Donation Tracking System** frontend, where users can donate, register, and track charity transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for smart contract compilation, testing, and deployment.
- **Solidity**: Language for writing smart contracts.
- **PHP**: Backend for the frontend of the DApp.
- **Composer**: Dependency management for PHP (if applicable).
- **ethers.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain (used in PHP via JS integration).
